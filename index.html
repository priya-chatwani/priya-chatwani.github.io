                <span class="header-text">I'm Priya (she/they)! </span> I grew up near Los Angeles and am usually on
                Ramaytush
                Ohlone land in the Bay Area, but I'm currently
                spending time in London. As a technologist and organizer, I center anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism,
                and intersectionality in my efforts to redestribute privilege and build political power on
                the Left.
                <br><br>
                <span class="header-text">Tech ~ </span> I'm a worker-owner at <a href="https://politicsrewired.com/"
                    target="_blank">Politics Rewired</a>,
                a Leftist tech co-operative that builds organizing technology for electoral candidates, unions, and
                progressive organizations. Previously, I worked on public transit planning tools at Remix and
                interned at Twitter, Google, and Infosys.
                While at Stanford, I co-taught "Coding for Social Good" and worked with the Haas Center for Public
                Service
                to curate "public interest tech" panels, career newsletters, resource guides, and summer
                and post-graduate fellowships.
                <br><br>
                <span class="header-text">Organizing ~ </span> Outside of my day job, I organize
                with Defund SFPD, Resource Generation, ASATA, and DSA SF, and I'm a founding board member
                of
                the <a href="https://www.voterempowerment.org/" target="_blank">Voter Empowerment Project</a>.
                I've also volunteered as a Bluebonnet data fellow on Marquita Bradshaw’s landmark 2020 Senate campaign
                and as a youth leader for They See / Desi Blue, an organization mobilizing South Asian American
                voters.<br><br>
                <span class="header-text">Community ~ </span> In March 2020, I helped build a mutual aid organization
                called <a
                    href="https://ktla.com/5-live/these-college-students-founded-an-organization-to-help-high-risk-people-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"
                    target="_blank">LA Helping Hands</a> for folks to deliver groceries and medications to their
                high-risk neighbors.
                Soon after, our friends started Helping Hands branches in their own
                cities, and as a Peace First ambassador, I helped support and fund other youth changemakers around the
                world. Other spaces where I find community include SF Adavu dance meet-ups, the Bay Area
                Solidary Summer youth organizer cohort, and Stanford's bhangra team and Center for
                South Asia</a>.
