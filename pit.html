        <br><span class="heading">Discovering Public Interest Tech<br></span>
        <div class="text">I entered the field of computer science because of an impactful class I took senior year of
            high school: Human-Centered Design.
            It was the first time that the class had been taught, and the ten of us felt empowered and excited as we
            learned about innovations that authentically met people's needs.<br><br>
            In my college degree, however, I did not easily find an emphasis on human-centered technology.
            And at my Google and Twitter internships, it was equally hard to find. Instead, I felt unfulfilled and out
            of place as I worked on technology that didn't excite me or have a visible positive impact.
            And after participating in an educational and immersive "alternative spring break" trip about housing
            inequality in the Bay Area, I realized how destructive these tech companies are to their surrounding
            communities.<br><br>
            In my senior year, an exciting opportunity came my way - I was hired as the first Public Interest Technology
            Student Assistant at the Haas Center for Public Service. In this role, I researched, created, and and raised
            awareness about public interest tech career and volunteer opportunities. Some of my tasks included:
            <ul>
                <li>adding public interest tech placements to our post-grad fellowships. This included reaching out
                    to numerous tech non profits and government branches and conversing with their recruiters and
                    employees.
                </li>
                <li>creating an open-source list of all the public interest tech organizations and contacts in
                    collaboration with students groups like CS+Social Good.
                </li>
                <li>starting a public interest tech careers newsletter. This involved looking through dozens of
                    job boards for internships and entry-level positions each week.
                </li>
                <li>hosting panels on technology's relationship to <a

                        target="_blank">
                        racial justice</a>, and politics in
                    collaboration with other student groups & university departments.
                </li>
                <li>facilitating collaboration and communication about public interest tech across different
                    labs, departments, student groups, and organizations.</li>
                <li>advocating for awareness of public interest tech among mainstream computer science events, such as
                    the annual hackathon and career fairs.</li>
                <li>recording a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MFPHn0kkTc" target="_blank">presentation</a>
                    about finding a career in public interest tech.</li>
                <li>creating and sharing flyers for public interest tech events.</li>
            </ul>
            I was lucky enough to find an entry-level, public interest tech role at <a href="https://www.remix.com/"
                target="_blank">Remix</a>,
            where we build design and analysis tools for transit agencies and departments of transportation. The way we
            center the needs of
            city planners and urban residents brings me back to that high school Human-Centered Design course.
            I hope roles like mine can become more accessible and I hope we can shift the tide in how technology is used
            - to uplift and empower those who have long been fighting for a more just world.<br><br>

                <li><b>Use those connections! 💪🏽</b><br><br>
                    One of the biggest takeaways from my job search: Don’t be afraid to send that cold email or LinkedIn
                    message!
                    People love talking about themselves, they feel good about paying it forward, and they usually get a
                    bonus
                    if someone they referred accepts an offer. 👀<br><br>
                    At this point, you should have a collection of companies that:<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Align with your values and meet all your must-haves,</li>
                        <li>Fall under the sector of public interest tech that interests you, and</li>
                        <li>Look to be hiring thanks to your job board snooping.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Now, take these companies and do some deep LinkedIn sleuthing. Can you find someone who works or
                    worked there with
                    the title that you want? Someone who shares one of your identities and is even more willing to open
                    a door for you?
                    <br><br>Once you identify those people, introduce yourself, express your interest in their company
                    and its mission, and ask them
                    what it is like to work there. Personally, I was shocked by how powerful a referral can be. Through
                    a cold LinkedIn
                    referral, I was offered an interview at an EdTech company that rejected my application just a week
                    prior!

                    Whether or not you get an offer from the company, reach back out to those contacts and close the
                    loop,
                    thanking them for their time and advice. Play the long game. The public interest tech space is
                    small, so
                    it’s worth staying in touch and building those lasting connections.

                <li><b>Pay it forward!</b><br><br>
                    Now that you are in a position of privilege due to the knowledge and connections you have acquired,
                    pay it forward and
                    share your learnings with others! And if you are class privileged, check out my tips on how to

            Now that you’ve landed a job in tech, here are some recommendations on how to #RockTheBoat, shake it up, and
            create lasting change.
            <br><br><b>NOTE:</b> Please consider how your various identities affect how you are perceived. These actions
            can negatively
            impact one’s job security, and the penalty is much higher for folks from marginalized communities.
            <ol>
                <li><b>Join an identity-based group.</b><br><br>
                    ERGs have become a crucial part of change in the tech industry at large corporations. These
                    identity-based groups
                    allow BIPOC folks, womxn, LGBTQ+ members, and others to support and advocate for one another as a
                    group.
                    <br><br>
                    If you want to join an ERG as an ally or manager, check with the group before doing so and be aware
                    of how much
                    space you take up. The goal is to center and support folks who don’t always have a voice.
                    <br><br>
                    If your organization does not have ERGs, advocate for them to be created! They have positive impacts
                    on
                    employees’ <a

                        sense of belonging</a> and are <a
                        href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0916/pages/are-employee-resource-groups-good-for-business.aspx"
                        target="_blank">
                        good for business</a> as well. But it doesn’t stop there. Ensure that the
                    time and energy spent on ERGs are valued and seen as work work. Advocate for executive funding and
                    sponsorship.
                    Being in an ERG does not make you the diversity educator of your company. In fact, it should reflect
                    positively
                    in performance reviews.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Ask the hard questions.</b><br><br>
                    To those in positions of privilege who are not concerned about job security:<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put your neck on the line when hard questions about diversity, inclusion, and equity need to
                            be asked. </li>
                        <li>Yes, your heart should be pounding and your pits should be sweating as you read your
                            question aloud.</li>
                        <li>If you can use statistics to back up your question.</li>
                        <li>Ask your question in a public forum or send it in a public chat. This not only holds members
                            of authority
                            accountable, as they should be held to a higher standard, but it also brings wider
                            visibility to important problems.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Push for inclusive hiring practices.</b><br><br>
                    Another good place to start is surrounding hiring practices.
                    Work with ERGs and/or a group of like-minded employees to create a list of requests.
                    Some items that you can request:<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is there a rubric for all interviews? Is that rubric shared with the candidate beforehand?
                            Have the rubric and interview questions been reviewed by ERGs and others at the company?
                            Without a rubric, it is too easy for interviewers to fall back on their biases and go with
                            whoever they deem “likeable”, aka whoever is the most like them. </li>
                        <li>Is there at least one woman or non-binary person and at least one BIPOC employee in every
                            interview? </li>
                        <li>How a candidate speaks to and interacts with folks from underrepresented groups is a
                            striking reflection of their character.</li>
                        <li>Can the hiring team openly share the demographic breakdowns of all job applicants? How about
                            the demographic breakdowns of applicant drop off at various stages in the pipeline?</li>
                        <li>Before extending an offer to an applicant, interview at least one woman or non-binary person
                            and at least one BIPOC person.</li>
                        <li>How can employees be involved in the interview process?</li>
                        <li>Where is the position being advertised? Is it being shared with identity-based groups,
                            conferences, community forums, and bootcamps like Include.io, AfroTech, and Techqueria?</li>
                        <li>Can department-specific demographic breakdowns of all employees be tracked and openly
                            shared?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Get involved in tech activist groups!</b><br><br>
                    The <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/" target="_blank">Tech Workers Coalition</a> is a
                    great way to work in solidarity with other tech workers who are
                    pressuring the industry from within and holding it accountable.

                    Another group to check out is <a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/" target="_blank">Collective
                        Action in Tech</a>, which documents collective actions and
                    allows workers to tell their stories, share resources, and theorize the tech workers movement
                    together.

                <br>
                <li><b>Who are your service workers???</b><br><br>
                    Almost every company employs service workers, and tech often goes the extra mile by hiring chefs,
                    cooks, servers, hashers, security guards, janitors, and maybe even shuttle bus drivers. Tech needs
                    to do better in sharing their wealth with ALL employees.<br><br>

                    According to advocacy group <a href="https://siliconvalleyrising.org/" target="_blank">Silicon
                        Valley Rising</a>,
                    “In the past two decades, the number of Silicon
                    Valley jobs in subcontracted industries has grown three times as fast as overall Silicon Valley
                    employment,” yet many of these service workers are paid poorly and not given basic benefits.

                <li><b>Where does your company invest and spend its $$?</b><br><br>
                    Encourage your company to purchase perks, gifts, and office supplies/decor from sustainable, local,
                    Black-owned, BIPOC-owned, womxn-owned, and
