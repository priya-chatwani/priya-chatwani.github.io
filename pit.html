        <br><span class="heading">Discovering Public Interest Tech<br></span>
        <div class="text">I entered the field of computer science because of an impactful class I took senior year of
            high school: Human-Centered Design.
            Throughout the course of this small, pilot class, I felt empowered and excited to
            learn about innovations that were thoughtfully designed to meet people's needs.<br><br>
            In my college coursework and internship experiences, however, I did not easily find a focus on human-centered technology.
            Additionally, after participating in an "alternative spring break" trip about housing
            inequality in the Bay Area and learning from community activists, I realized how destructive these tech companies are to their surrounding
            communities.<br><br>
            In my senior year, an exciting opportunity came my way - I was hired as the first Public Interest Technology
            Student Assistant at the Haas Center for Public Service. In this role, I researched, created, and and raised
            awareness about public interest tech career and volunteer opportunities - opportunities I wish I had at the start of college. 
            Some of my tasks included:
            <ul>
                <li>adding 10 public interest tech placements to our post-grad fellowships. This included reaching out
                    to numerous tech non profits and government branches and conversing with their recruiters and
                    employees.
                </li>
                <li>creating an open-source list of all the public interest tech organizations and contacts in
                    collaboration with students groups like CS+Social Good.
                </li>
                <li>starting a public interest tech careers newsletter. This involved looking through dozens of
                    job boards for internships and entry-level positions each week.
                </li>
                <li>hosting panels on technology's relationship to <a
                        href="https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/04/08/airbnbs-rob-chesnut-discusses-how-tech-companies-can-maintain-integrity-during-covid-19/"
                        target="_blank">
                        ethics and Covid-19</a>, <a

                        target="_blank">
                        racial justice</a>, and politics in
                    collaboration with other student groups & university departments.
                </li>
                <li>facilitating collaboration and communication about public interest tech across different
                    labs, departments, student groups, and organizations.</li>
                <li>advocating for awareness of public interest tech among mainstream computer science events, such as
                    the annual hackathon and career fairs.</li>
                <li>recording a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MFPHn0kkTc" target="_blank">presentation</a>
                    about finding a career in public interest tech.</li>
                <li>creating and sharing flyers for public interest tech events.</li>
            </ul>
            I was lucky enough to find an entry-level, public interest tech role at <a href="https://www.remix.com/"
                target="_blank">Remix</a>,
            where we build design and analysis tools for transit and street planners. Throughout our design and development, we
            center the needs of
            local government agencies and urban residents, bringing me back to that high school Human-Centered Design course.
            I hope roles in public interest tech can become more accessible as we break up big tech and shift the tide in how technology is used, 
            ensuring that innovation uplifts
            all citizens and supports those who have long been fighting for a more just society.<br><br>

                <li><b>Use those connections! 💪🏽</b><br><br>
                    At this point, you should have a collection of companies that:<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Align with your values and meet all your must-haves,</li>
                        <li>Fall under the sector of public interest tech that interests you, and</li>
                        <li>Look to be hiring thanks to your job board snooping.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Now, take these companies and do some deep LinkedIn sleuthing. Can you find someone who works or
                    has worked there? Maybe even someone who shares one of your identities or interests?
                    <br><br>Once you identify those people, introduce yourself, express your interest in their company's mission, and ask 
                    what it's like to work there. You'd be surprised how far a referral can take you!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Build your network.</b><br><br>
                    Whether or not you get an offer from the company, reach back out to your contacts and close the
                    loop,
                    thanking them for their time and advice. Play the long game. The public interest tech space is
                    small, so
                    it’s worth staying in touch and building those lasting connections.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Pay it forward!</b><br><br>
                    Now that you've acquired some information about public interest tech and some connections along 
                    the way, share your learnings with others! And once you've landed that job, don't be afraid to #RockTheBoat by 
                asking hard questions, pushing for inclusive hiring practices, and ensuring that your product is accessible and beneficial to 
            groups of all identities.</li>
